## Introduction
Heart disease prediction is essential for early intervention and treatment. This project explores multiple machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease based on clinical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and contains various clinical attributes. 

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/S-NELSON-001/Heart-disease-prediction-using-ML.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Heart-disease-prediction-using-ML
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. Run the `HeartDisease.ipynb` notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Models and Accuracy
The following classification algorithms were tested:
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

The Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8688524590163934.
